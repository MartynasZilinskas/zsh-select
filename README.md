## Introduction

A shell command that will display selection list. It is similar to `selecta`
and other such tools, but uses curses library to do display. It is written in
Zshell and has it's capabilities:

- patterns, allowing multi-term searching
- curses module
- approximate matching (`Ctrl-F`)

## Installation

Simply copy file `zsh-select` to any `bin` directory such as `/usr/local/bin`.
That's everything that is needed and what is expected.

Nevertheless, for quick download and try, the package is available as plugin.
This limits use for interactive shells only.
